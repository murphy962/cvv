    <h3><p>who is christ?</p></h3><hr>
<br>

<p>Jesus came into our world two thousand years ago to powerfully demonstrate Gods love for us.<br>

    In sending Jesus into our broken but beautiful world, God was showing all of us how much he loves us.
    
    In our brokenness and sin, God knew we needed rescuing from ourselves; we needed a Saviour. In his love and grace our Creator God allowed his own Son, Jesus Christ to die for us, once and for all dealing with our sin and rebellion. Three days later Jesus rose from the grave and the world would never be the same again!
    
    Jesus said: <br><em>“I have come that you may have life; life better than you could ever imagine it to be.<strong>” (John 10:10)</strong></em><br>
    
    Through a personal relationship with Jesus we open the door to forgiveness, hope, meaning and purpose in life. <br>
    We see how much God loves us and how good his plans are for our lives. We discover the joy of living for others and making a difference in our world.<br> We see that Jesus came to make us stronger and better people.<br> He came to open the door to new possibilities in our lives and relationships.<br>
    Everyone at One Church is on a journey, we haven’t arrived! But we know the difference Jesus brings to life.<br>
     We invite you to join us, hear more about Jesus and discover a life shaped by love, hope and purpose!</p>

<h4><p>It is said that <em>VICTORY</em> is when a Battle is won .</p></h4>
